# PCA-and-TSNE-on-diabetes-dataset
I use sklearn to run logistic regression, PCA and TSNE.

I use PCA and t-SNE method to compare the impact from three of tested parameters for diabetes development. It allows to see which two of them taken together affects diabetes the most. I use both, PCA and t-SNE method to compare, which of them is a better tool in our case. We can see that results on both methods lead to similar conclusions, but PCA is more transparent in our case.

In my work I compared only three of ten parameters. The next step, which should be taken is running PCA and t-SNE for other parameters and choose the most important ones.
